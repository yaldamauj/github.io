# GitHub Pages Portfolio Starter

A minimal, accessible, and fast portfolio you can deploy to GitHub Pages in minutes.

## Quick Start

1. Create a repository named **`YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io`** (replace with your username).
2. Upload the files from this folder to that repo (or drag-and-drop the ZIP contents in the web UI).
3. Go to **Settings â†’ Pages** and set:
   - **Branch:** `main`
   - **Folder:** `/ (root)`
4. Visit `https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io`.

## Customize

- Edit `index.html`:
  - Replace **Your Name**, GitHub/LinkedIn links, email, and project cards.
  - Duplicate a `<li class="card"> ... </li>` block to add more projects.
- Edit `style.css` to tweak spacing, fonts, or colors.
- Want multiple pages? Add more `.html` files and link them from the nav.

## Tips

- Create a repo for each project, write a clear README, and link it here.
- Add screenshots (put them in an `/assets` folder and reference with `<img>`).
- Use your domain: set a `CNAME` file with your domain and configure DNS (GitHub docs).

Happy shipping!
